				 <h3>INTERN</h3>
					<p>This is the first step an affiliates takes in the journey to success. You sign up with different package and earn at different level deep depending on the package you sign up with. You can sign up with basic package which will be upgraded for free within a specific time of 70day interval from the date of sign up or upgrade to next package until you attain a master account. Once the grace period expires.</p>
					<p>upgrade fee of 1500 is charged. Once you sign up with any package the point value (PV) and other commissions are distributed accordingly. And when there is an upgrade to any package the balance of corresponding point value (PV) is added to you.</p>
					<p>Example: - when Mike sign up with basic package (13500) he gets 80pv and when and upgrade is done to master package (40500) 27000 will be deducted from his earning 160pv will be added to him and when he upgrade to professional package (67500) 40500 will be deducted from his earning the balance of 160pv will also be added to him to cumulate it to 400pv. When it is direct from basic to professional 320PV will be added. Same happens to the up links as you upgrade they get the point value (PV) accordingly.</p>
